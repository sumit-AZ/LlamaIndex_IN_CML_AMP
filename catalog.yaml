     short_description: A demonstration of how CML can host LLM models using HuggingFace and streamit
     long_description: >-
        The goal of this application is to demonstrate how an Open Source LLM model
        can be deployed on CML. The application is built using the RAG architecture
        with an in-memory Chroma Database.
